* These are draft notes. Mostly to document developing thinking about what could be the possibility of a research-based architectural practice? Architecture is largely an art and style-based practice for a period. This changed around the 1980s to investigate new sites and agencies of patronage. Even the research practice is now changing to find its place in the architectural post-information age. There is too much information around that needs ways to address, create newer grounds of architectural theory. Previously it was necessary to build, as a form of reflection of the kind of contribution that is distinct from other practices but today building physically at least is subject to the kind of patronage the practice receives. The way the world is changing, especially through the types of information flows produced it is also getting difficult to clearly locate even what architecture could be. If writing is a project, how can the architectural research project take form for the times it is in. Scales of knowledge flow too from the time of reflective practices also have changed. Research is done now somewhere between entertainment and academic obligation and maybe news. Learning from Koolhaas's research trajectory is the follow the money. In addition to money, today software plays a significant role in even defining what is even understood as architecture. There are only two types of software that are produced, all software you have to pay for in some way, i.e. closed source code and open source code. Of what I understand. Architecture knowledge has always been open-source, therefore can architectural research practice function as open-source software projects. Some questions come up immediately. What is an architectural practice? If architectural services are produced as open-source knowledge, what value will they generate? How can it develop in a similar framework open-source applications provide? Theoretically, architecture is a virtual profession. To clarify, an architect provides services that give instructions on how a building or a spatial strategy is implemented IRL. Architecture is not lived but produced as a performance to continue a practice of building.
